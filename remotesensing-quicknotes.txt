remote sensing quicknotes

-NSERP_AllPlots.csv is slightly outdated (couple hard-to-catch typos in veg plots
		that were still inside study area but in slightly wrong locn)
-NSERP_VegPlots is right (but doesn't include pellet plots)
-Need Brady to rerun after you're sure you've actually caught all issues

not sure if these are technically outliers, but...
-401.2014-07-18.40 ARTTRI 106.9 basal diam - puts biomass an order of magnitude > other plots
-376.2014-07-17.0 ARTTRI 79.78 basal diam - not order of mag >, but still pretty big and doesn't fit general trend of data
-so, note to self i guess... sagebrush doesn't track well with NDVI/EVI (duh, it's not very green)
